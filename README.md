# Computer-Vision-Image-Classification-for-Cracks-or-No-Cracks-Dataset

## An image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks

This assessment necessitated an image classification task to distinguish between concrete surfaces with and without cracks. Various types of common concrete cracks were considered, including hairline cracks that typically emerge in concrete foundations during the curing process, shrinkage cracks occurring as the concrete cures, settlement cracks resulting from uneven settling or inadequate compaction of the ground beneath the slab, and structural cracks formed due to design errors.
