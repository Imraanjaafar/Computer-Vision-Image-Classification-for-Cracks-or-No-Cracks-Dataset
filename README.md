# Computer-Vision-Image-Classification-for-Cracks-or-No-Cracks-Dataset

## An image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks

This assessment necessitated an image classification task to distinguish between concrete surfaces with and without cracks. Various types of common concrete cracks were considered, including hairline cracks that typically emerge in concrete foundations during the curing process, shrinkage cracks occurring as the concrete cures, settlement cracks resulting from uneven settling or inadequate compaction of the ground beneath the slab, and structural cracks formed due to design errors. The dataset used in this project are from https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/files/8a70d8a5-bce9-4291-bab9-b48cfb3e87c3/file_downloaded that contains the omages of concrete surfaces with and without cracks.

- [Imran_Assesment1.py](https://github.com/Imraanjaafar/Computer-Vision-Image-Classification-for-Cracks-or-No-Cracks-Dataset/blob/main/Imran_Assesment1.py) : Contains code for Data Loading, Further split validation and test dataset, Image augmentation, Data Normalization and model training/Model fine tune training.
## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 96.16% on the test set, which demonstrates its effectiveness in classifying concrete images with and without cracks.
